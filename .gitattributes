# Store generated CSV artifacts in Git LFS to avoid GitHub size limits.
# NOTE: docs/data/*.csv must NOT be in LFS — GitHub Pages cannot serve LFS objects,
# it would serve the pointer file instead of the actual CSV data.
#
# Heavy daily files (150–250 MB each) are excluded from LFS: storing them would
# exhaust GitHub Free's 1 GB/month LFS bandwidth quota in a single workflow run.
# They are rebuilt from silver on every CI run and uploaded directly to Pages as
# part of the artifact — they are never committed to git.
