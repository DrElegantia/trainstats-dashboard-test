# Gold CSV files: stored as regular git objects (NOT LFS).
#
# Using LFS for gold files exhausts GitHub Free's 1 GB/month LFS bandwidth
# quota when each CI run downloads all historical gold objects on checkout.
# The light gold files are small enough for regular git (total ~16 MB growing
# slowly); the heavy daily files are gitignored and never committed at all.
#
# NOTE: docs/data/*.csv must NOT be in LFS — GitHub Pages cannot serve LFS
# objects; it would serve the pointer file instead of the actual CSV data.
